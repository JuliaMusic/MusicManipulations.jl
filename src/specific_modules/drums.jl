    rm_hihatfake(notes; kwargs...)

Remove fake hihat notes (typically in a drums recording of the TD50 drumset)
generated by certain actions.
Remove every pitch in `cut_pitches` (by default the Hihat Head event)
with velocity less than `cutoff_fc`
and position maximum `back` ticks before or `forw` ticks after a foot close.
Triggers to search for are pitches are given by the keyword
`triggers = (0x2c, 0x1a, 0x16)` (foot close and hi hat rim).

After that, all notes with pitches in `cut_pitches` and `velocity ≤ cutoff_vel`
are deleted as well, which accounts for spurious note triggering.
